Using Jekyll for the Annotator "News" Section
* Ensure that the jekyll gem is installed on your machine
* The jekyll source dir is _news/, and destination dir is news/.
* To add a post, cd into _news/, and run 'rake post title="Your Title Here"'.
  This will create a file in _posts. Edit the content of the post in that file
  to your heart's desire.
* After you've edited your post, run "jekyll build" from the _news/ directory,
  which will compile into news/. Note that _news/ is checked into the
  repository but news/ is gitignored. Upon deploy, "jekyll build" needs to to
  be run to compile into news/ which will get committed on the gh-pages branch
  to appear on the live site.
* The CSS paths in _news/head.html are set as absolute paths to ensure they
  will include the base directory CSS files. This may cause problems in your
  development instance if you are not running on the localhost path.

After finishing your post:
* Use `git add` and `git commit` your post.
* Run `jekyll build` from the _news/ directory.

To update the live site:
* Ensure the news directory is built as above. Run `jekyll build` from _news/.
* Use the `rake ghp` command to commit the latest news to the gh-pages branch.
* Push the gh-pages branch.
